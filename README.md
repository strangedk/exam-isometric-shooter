# exam-isometric-shooter
An exam, looking like isometric shooter with the free assets. It's not will be using by commerce benefits. Just to make it looking good.

To launch project invoke the next commands:

`npm i`
`npm run start`

I've using the Parcel bundler, because I'd try to something less complicated than webpack/snowpack.
Therefore, the assets are stored in the dist right now. But I know, that it should be copied with a Parcel copy plugin.

Some things are using mock/hardcode data, but that implies that in the real game they should be loaded from the server or at least should be splitted into the different datas with an access by enums/interfaces and so on.
